## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, part 2

  This was one of the more fun labs we’ve had because it was really light, simple, and enjoyable to code. What I enjoyed the most was coding the if, else if, and else statements. These are some of the most favorite parts about coding in general; figuring out how to make conditionals so something will only work under specific circumstances.

* Lab 8, part 2

  This was one of the more interesting and brain-teasing labs, especially the second part. We had to write a program that prints out a specific pattern, which at first I was troubled on how to even begin. However, as I figured out how to write each of the for-loops, everything came together pretty smoothly.

* Lab 10, part 1

  The part 1 of lab 10 was fairly interesting, too. We were tasked to create a program that is able to search through the vector and output a county’s population count and percentage of the state’s population within that county. I had run into an issue where I was unable to search through counties that have spaces in their names, making it so that the program only records the first word, and producing an error because it is not a complete name. I fixed this by transforming spaces into periods. This way, it will be detected as one word only, making it a simple solution.
